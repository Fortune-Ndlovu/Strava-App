# Strava Replica in React

Welcome to the Strava Replica project in React! This project is a recreation of the Strava web application, aiming to provide a similar user experience and functionality to the original platform. Below, you will find an overview of the project's goals, iterations, and how to get started with development.

## Project Overview

The Strava Replica project is a part of my final year in the Level 8 BSc (Hons) Creative Media and Design program at the Technology University of the Shannon: Midland Midwest (TUS). It's a comprehensive project that involves coding, design, and a user-centric approach. The project is divided into iterations, each building upon the previous one to ultimately recreate the core features of the Strava platform.

## Iterations

### Iteration 1: Basic UI Setup, Header, Footer, and Routes with Strava API Integration

- Set up the foundational structure of the application, including the header, footer, and routing system.
- Integrate the Strava API to retrieve and display users' activity data.

### Iteration 2: Implementing Activity Creation and Deletion

- Allow users to create and delete activities within the application.
- Note that this iteration does not involve user authentication but focuses on activity management.

### Iteration 3: Activity Details and Analysis

- Implement the display of detailed activity information and analysis, such as distance, pace, and elevation.
- This iteration does not involve user authentication but focuses on enhancing activity details.

### Iteration 4: Implement Heart Rate Monitor Integration

- Integrate data from a heart rate monitor into the application, providing users with valuable fitness data.
- This iteration does not involve user authentication but focuses on fitness data integration.

### Iteration 5: Social Features

- Implement a friend/follower system, allowing users to connect with others and share activities.
- This iteration does not involve user authentication but focuses on enhancing social features.

### Iteration 6: User Authentication Enhancement

- Enhance the existing user authentication system, potentially adding social login options and refining the logout process.
- This iteration builds upon the authentication implemented in Iteration 1, improving the user experience.

### Final Refinements and Testing Iterations

- Conduct a series of final iterations to refine and optimize the application.
- Focus on Accessibility, performance, usability, and addressing any feedback received during the development process.
