# Strava Replica in React

Welcome to the Strava Replica project in React! This project is a recreation of the Strava web application, aiming to provide a similar user experience and functionality to the original platform. Below, you will find an overview of the project's goals, iterations, and how to get started with development.

## Project Overview

The Strava Replica project is a part of my final year in the Level 8 BSc (Hons) Creative Media and Design program at the Technology University of the Shannon: Midland Midwest (TUS). It's a comprehensive project that involves coding, design, and a user-centric approach. The project is divided into iterations, each building upon the previous one to ultimately recreate the core features of the Strava platform.

## Project Iterations

### Iteration 1: Basic UI Setup, Header, Footer, Routes, and Strava API Integration (Minimum Viable Product)

- Set up the basic UI structure, including a header and footer.
- Create a landing page that displays essential information about the user (name, profile picture) retrieved from the Strava API.
- Implement routing to enable navigation within the application.
- Integrate the Strava API to fetch and display the user's basic activity data (e.g., recent activities).

### Iteration 2: Activity Management

- Allow users to create new activities, specifying type, duration, and date.
- Implement the functionality to delete activities.
- Ensure seamless integration with the Strava API for activity data synchronization.

### Iteration 3: Activity Details and Analysis

- Design and implement a dedicated page to display detailed activity information.
- Integrate analysis features, such as distance, speed, and elevation data for each activity.
- Ensure a smooth transition from activity listing to detailed view.

### Iteration 4: Heart Rate Monitor Integration

- Integrate a heart rate monitor API to collect real-time heart rate data during activities.
- Display the heart rate data appropriately on the activity detail page.
- Ensure compatibility and accuracy with various heart rate monitor devices.

### Iteration 5: Social Features and Interaction

- Implement a friend/follower system, allowing users to connect with each other.
- Enable users to share their activities and interact by liking and commenting on them.
- Implement real-time notifications for social interactions within the platform.

### Iteration 6: Authentication Enhancement and User Profiles

- Enhance user authentication with features like email verification and password reset.
- Implement social login options, such as Google and Facebook authentication.
- Enhance the user profile with customizable avatars, activity history, and user statistics.

### Final Refinements and Testing Iterations

- Conduct a series of final iterations to refine and optimize the application.
- Focus on Accessibility, performance, usability, and addressing any feedback received during the development process.
